# # Day 28 : The Earth is not flat
#
# The Earth isnâ€™t flat (AFAIK), so how would you show that on a map?
# Maybe something creative with projections?

# %%
import pygmt

# %% [markdown]
# ## Plot the map!
#
# Let's keep things simple and plot an
# [Azimuthal Equidistant](https://www.pygmt.org/v0.5.0/projections/azim/azim_equidistant.html)
# projection map. More details about the projection are at
# https://docs.generic-mapping-tools.org/latest/cookbook/map-projections.html#azimuthal-equidistant-projection-je-je.
#
# The background will be NASA's Blue Marble imagery at 6 arc-minute resolution
# provided through the GMT data server, see
# https://docs.generic-mapping-tools.org/6.2/datasets/remote-data.html#global-earth-day-night-images
# for more details. The image will be shaded with some earth relief, and some
# gridlines will also be added on top. All of this will be done in a single
# [`fig.grdview`](https://www.pygmt.org/v0.5.0/api/generated/pygmt.Figure.grdview.html)
# function call!
