# Day 15 : Map made without using a computer

Baking a 3D Antarctic cake!
This was a sweet collaboration between Alena, Yaowen, Lara, Jamey and me at the
[Antarctic Research Centre](https://www.wgtn.ac.nz/antarctic) back in May 2021.

## Ingredients

### Oreo 'bedrock' (line on a 25cm diameter round tin)
- 1 pack of oreos
- 120g butter

### Chocolate brownie 'sediment' (use 15cm diameter tin)
- 4 tbsp cocoa powder
- 200g sugar
- 200g butter
- 3 free-range eggs
- 200g self-rising flour

### Blue 'ocean' cake (use 25cm diameter tin)
- 400g sugar
- 400g butter
- 400g self-rising flour
- 8 free-range eggs
- 2tbsp milk
- blue food colouring

### Icing (divide into 2 portions, colour one blue, keep the other white)
- 400g sugar
- 150g butter
- 2-3tbsp hot water

## Notes

The cake layers were baked in separate tins and then assembled.
A ~15cm diameter hole the shape of Antarctica was cut from the middle
of the 25cm blue cake, and we fitted the choc brownie sediment inside.
The blue ocean and white ice buttercream was then spread on top.


## Disclaimer

The ingredient list is not very precise, and I don't think everyone followed
them exactly, so if you have more baking experience, definitely use your own
judgement on this.
